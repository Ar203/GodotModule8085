# GodotModule8085
cpp module for 8085 emulation

A college project created by the author Ar203

The *gd files are scripts for the godot engine.
The *.cpp files have the backend functions
Assembler.cpp and Assembler.h are not required as godot doesn't support std::string to String converstion(:-<)

However similar implementation of assembler is available in the Main.gd file written in godot script.

module8085.cpp and module8085.h are glue code to integrate cpp functions into godot engine.
